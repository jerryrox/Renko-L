### Still work-in-progress... but it's usable :D

# Renko-L

A new Github Wiki page was created!

Check out the following link for details.  
> https://github.com/jerryrox/Renko-L/wiki/Renko-L

From this point onwards, I will use the Wiki pages for documentation.  
Of course, I'll make sure each namespace folder contains a README file that links to the corresponding Wiki page.
